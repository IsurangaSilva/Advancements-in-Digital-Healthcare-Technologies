Depression Detection Through Voice Pattern Recognition :

This component leverages advanced audio analysis techniques to identify depression severity by examining features such as voice depth, pitch, and tone. The system preprocesses audio using tools like Librosa to remove noise and trim irrelevant segments, ensuring clear and high-quality inputs. It then extracts essential features such as MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) and other spectral attributes for accurate emotion detection.
A CNN-based deep learning model processes the extracted features to detect emotions like happiness, sadness, or anger and their intensity levels. The system maps these emotional intensities to corresponding depression levels, providing valuable insights for early detection and continuous emotional monitoring. This approach integrates technologies like Python, Librosa, and TensorFlow/Keras to deliver a robust solution for mental health assessment.


Depression Detection through enhance Text Pattern Analyzation :

Depression Detection Based on Text employs advanced deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text data for detecting depression. The system focuses on extracting features, processing sequential patterns, and gaining emotional insights to identify depression indicators.
The process begins with SpeechBrain, which converts audio into text, enabling linguistic and emotional analysis. Sentiment analysis tools like VADER and TextBlob evaluate sentiment polarity, subjectivity, and subtle emotional changes, offering key markers associated with depression. The core architecture integrates a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. CNNs extract spatial features from text, such as word frequency, sentence complexity, and syntactical patterns. LSTMs process sequential dependencies and emotional expressions to highlight prolonged depressive behaviors.
The system also performs emotion detection through text, identifying states as emotions and it's level, and maps these to depression indicators.

Detecting Depression by analyzing userâ€™s facial expressions :

Depression Detection Through Facial Emotions utilizes computer vision and deep learning to examine facial expressions for indications of depression. The system aims to identify and categorize emotions, examine mood trends over time, and connect these patterns to possible signs of depression.
Face detection is driven by the faceNet-PyTorch library, which extracts facial areas from real-time video. A fine-tuned EfficientNet model categorizes emotions such as happy, angry, sad, etc. During a specified period, observed emotions are combined to recognize recurring mood trends, which serve as the foundation for depression assessment.
Through the integration of emotion detection and mood monitoring, the system provides a non-intrusive, precise, and forward-looking method to recognize initial indicators of depression, guaranteeing consistent effectiveness across different circumstances.

Develop a Comprehensive Voice Companion for Personalized Mental Health Support :

The AI companion is designed to provide personalized emotional and mental support, aiming to enhance user well-being by helping them manage stress, anxiety, and depression. This companion uses advanced fine-tuning techniques on the LLaMA 3, 2, 1B model, utilizing multi-fine-tuning strategies to specialize in different domains of emotional support. By applying hybrid fine-tuning approaches, it can focus on specific mental health areas, making it more effective for individual needs. The goal is to create a lightweight yet highly responsive companion that can adapt to the user's emotional state, providing timely and relevant guidance to improve their mental health and overall focus.
