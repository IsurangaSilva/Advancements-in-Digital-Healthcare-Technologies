#Introduction to the Project 
This web application for depression treatment integrates advanced artificial intelligence to provide real-time, personalized counseling. At its core is an AI voice companion powered by an enhanced large language model (LLM), offering meaningful and supportive dialogues that adapt to the user’s emotional state. It also features Facial Emotion Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect user emotions via the device’s front camera. Additionally, a Voice-to-Text system and a Voice Classification Model based on Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) assess mood and signs of depression. The application ensures data privacy and security through encryption, adhering to legislative requirements.
